# Pre-work - TipMeOut

TipMeOut is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Jonathon Chenvert

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Listed total bill cost when split among six people.

## Notes

Some challenges faced during this project include the localization for currency and thousands separator, remembering the bill amount acorss app restarts (in how to implement them as well), and creating six UILabels and initializing them within an array. Storyboard designing is also included as a challenge, but that is mostly due to me not knowing much when it comes to design implementation.
